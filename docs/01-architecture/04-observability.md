# Observability

UmrohOS uses the full OTel stack from day one. Logs, metrics, and traces all flow into Grafana so you can pivot between them with a single trace ID.

## The pipeline

```
Go service ──zerolog (stdout JSON)── Fluent-Bit ── Loki ──┐
           │                                              │
           │──OTLP gRPC── OpenTelemetry Collector ── Tempo─┤── Grafana
           │                                              │
           │──/metrics──   Prometheus scraper ────────────┘
```

All three converge in Grafana. Loki, Tempo, and Prometheus are configured as data sources; Grafana correlates them via the `trace_id` field.

## Tracing

- Every service uses `util/tracing.InitTracer` at startup. See `baseline/go-backend-template/demo-svc/util/tracing/`.
- Every API method, every service method, and every store method opens a span.
- Span attributes record: operation name, key input parameters (no PII), error details on failure.
- Trace context propagates across gRPC calls automatically via OTel interceptors.
- Temporal workflows propagate trace context across activities.

## Logging

- zerolog with JSON output to stdout.
- **Always** use `logging.LogWithTrace(ctx, logger)` to get a logger that includes the current `trace_id`. Never use a raw `logger` inside a request handler or service method.
- Standard fields on every log line: `level`, `time`, `service`, `trace_id`, `span_id`, `caller`.
- No PII in logs (no full passport numbers, no full payment data — log only IDs).
- Log levels:
  - `debug` — verbose, off in prod
  - `info` — service-method entry/exit, key state changes
  - `warn` — recoverable problems
  - `error` — failures that returned an error
  - `fatal` — startup failures only

## Metrics

- Prometheus scrapes each service's `/metrics` endpoint.
- Standard metrics from the template: HTTP request count/latency by route+status, gRPC request count/latency, DB pool stats, panic counter.
- Add custom business metrics via `util/monitoring`. Examples for UmrohOS to add over time:
  - `bookings_created_total`
  - `payments_received_total{provider}`
  - `visa_pipeline_duration_seconds`
  - `commission_calculated_total{level}`

## Dashboards

- Grafana home dashboard shows: per-service request rate, error rate, p95 latency, DB pool saturation.
- Per-service dashboards: scaffolded under `grafana/dashboards/<svc>.json` when the service is built.

## Reading a trace

1. Hit Grafana → Explore → Tempo.
2. Search by trace ID (from a log line) or by service+operation+latency filter.
3. Click a span to see its attributes (params, error).
4. Use the "logs for this span" link to jump to Loki and see all log lines tagged with that trace ID.

This is the workflow the reviewer should use when reviewing a session: pick a sample request, find its trace, walk it through every service, and confirm each log line is meaningful.

## What to verify on every new service

The `scaffold-service` skill ensures these are wired:
- [ ] `/metrics` endpoint reachable
- [ ] zerolog initialized with `LogWithTrace`
- [ ] OTel tracer initialized in `cmd/start.go`
- [ ] Service appears in Grafana with at least one trace after a smoke request
- [ ] Logs for the smoke request appear in Loki tagged with the right service name
